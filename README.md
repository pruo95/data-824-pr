# data-824-pr
## This repo holds my final project for Data 824

hallOfFameDashboard.R holds the code for the UI and server and the dataset.  There is also an R file for just the required code which can be found at hallOfFameDataset.R

The UI and Server can also be found separated in their respective files.

The data tables used are all found in the R package "Lahman", so no csv, text file, etc. will need to be downloaded to run the dashboard.
